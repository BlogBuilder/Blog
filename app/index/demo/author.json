  "desp": "Hopefully you have created an excellent resume prior to the interview day which highlighted your strengths and accomplishments.  The first meeting is a time to present these in verbal form.  Although it may seem like repeating yourself, you can not be sure that the interviewer has looked over your document.  In some companies, interviewers are so poorly prepared that they only spend 15-30 seconds looking at your background before the session.",
